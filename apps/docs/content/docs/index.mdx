## Welcome to Evalite

Evalite is a TypeScript-native, local-first tool for testing LLM-powered apps built on Vitest. It allows developers to write evaluations (evals) as `.eval.ts` files that run like tests.

## Key Features

- **Local-first**: Run evals locally on your machine with complete control of your data
- **TypeScript-native**: Write evals in TypeScript with full type safety
- **Built on Vitest**: Use all the same tools (mocks, lifecycle hooks) you're used to
- **Live reload**: Local server with hot reload for rapid iteration
- **Traces & Scorers**: Capture traces, build custom scorers, and much more
