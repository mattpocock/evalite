We're going to walk through setting up Evalite in an existing project.

<Steps>

<Step>

Install `evalite`, `vitest`, and a scoring library like `autoevals`:

```npm
npm install -D evalite vitest autoevals
```

</Step>

<Step>

Add an `eval:dev` script to your package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "eval:dev": "evalite watch"
  }
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

Create your first eval:

```ts
// my-eval.eval.ts

import { evalite } from "evalite";
import { Levenshtein } from "autoevals";

evalite("My Eval", {
  // An array of test data
  // - TODO: Replace with your test data
  data: [{ input: "Hello", expected: "Hello World!" }],
  // The task to perform
  // - TODO: Replace with your LLM call
  task: async (input) => {
    return input + " World!";
  },
  // The scoring methods for the eval
  scorers: [Levenshtein],
});
```

`.eval.ts` is the extension Evalite looks for when scanning for evals.

</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

Run `pnpm run eval:dev`.

```npm
npm run eval:dev
```

This runs `evalite`, which runs the evals:

- Runs the `data` function to get the test data
- Runs the `task` function on each test data
- Scores the output of the `task` function using the `scorers`
- Saves the results to a sqlite database in `node_modules/.evalite`

It then:

- Shows a UI for viewing the traces, scores, inputs and outputs at http://localhost:3006.
- If you only ran one eval, it also shows a table summarizing the eval in the terminal.

</Step>

<Step>

Open http://localhost:3006 in your browser to view the results of the eval.

</Step>

</Steps>

### What Next?

Head to the [AI SDK example](/examples/ai-sdk) to see a fully-fleshed out example of Evalite in action.

### Troubleshooting

##### Error: Could not locate the bindings file

Some users experienced issues running `evalite watch`. Your package manager will report the following error message:

```
Command failed, Error: Could not locate the bindings file.
```

This error is related to the `better-sqlite3` package. To resolve this, you can try the following steps:

- Rebuild `better-sqlite3`:

```bash
pnpm rebuild better-sqlite3
```

- Approve the rebuild of the package with:

```bash
pnpm approve-builds
```
