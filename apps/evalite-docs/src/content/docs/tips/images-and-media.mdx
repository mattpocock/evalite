Test multi-modal LLM features by including images, audio, and video in your evals.

## Files In Memory

A common way to work with media in Evalite is to read it into memory.

### What Are Files In Memory?

If you've got a file in memory, it's probably going to be in a buffer, or a `Uint8Array`. For instance, in Node, calling `readFileSync` will return a `Buffer`:

```ts
import { readFileSync } from "fs";

const fileContents = readFileSync("path/to/file.jpg");
//    ^ Buffer
```

This `Buffer` contains all the information about the file, stored in memory. You can write it to another file like so:

```ts
import { writeFileSync } from "fs";

writeFileSync("path/to/new-file.jpg", fileContents);
```

It doesn't matter what the file extension is - when you read it into memory, it'll be a `Buffer`.

<Aside>
  A `Buffer` is just a `Uint8Array` with some extra methods, so from now on I'll
  just refer to them as `Uint8Array` objects.

### Evalite And Files In Memory

Evalite can automatically detect `Uint8Array` objects in your evals and handle them for you.

```ts
import { evalite } from "evalite";
import { reportTrace } from "evalite/traces";

evalite("My Eval", {
  data: [
    {
      // 1. In inputs...
      input: readFileSync("path/to/file.jpg"),
      // 2. ...in expected...
      expected: readFileSync("path/to/file.jpg"),
    },
  ],
  task: async (input) => {
    reportTrace({
      // 3. ...in traces...
      input: readFileSync("path/to/file.jpg"),
      output: readFileSync("path/to/file.jpg"),
    });

    // 4. ...returned from the task itself...
    return readFileSync("path/to/new-file.jpg", input);
  },
  columns: async () => {
    return [
      {
        label: "File",
        // 5. ...and returned from customColumns:
        value: readFileSync("path/to/new-file.jpg", input),
      },
    ];
  },
  scorers: [],
});
```

When Evalite finds a `Uint8Array`, it saves the file to a local cache, in `./node_modules/.evalite/files`.

Then in the UI, it'll reference that local file.

## Files On Disk

If you're working with files on disk, you can use the `EvaliteFile.fromPath` method to reference them:

```ts
import { EvaliteFile, evalite } from "evalite";

evalite("My Eval", {
  data: [
    {
      input: EvaliteFile.fromPath("path/to/file.jpg"),
    },
  ],
  task: async (input) => {
    console.log(input.path); // "path/to/file.jpg"
  },
  scorers: [],
});
```

This lets you display an image in the UI without having to read it into memory.
