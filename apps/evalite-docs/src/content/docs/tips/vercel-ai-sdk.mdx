Use Evalite with Vercel's [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction) to trace LLM calls and test AI-powered features.

## Automatic Tracing with `traceAISDKModel`

Wrap your AI SDK model in `traceAISDKModel` to automatically track all LLM calls:

```ts
// my-eval.eval.ts

import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { streamText } from "ai";
import { Factuality, Levenshtein } from "autoevals";
import { evalite } from "evalite";
import { traceAISDKModel } from "evalite/ai-sdk";

evalite("Test Capitals", {
  data: async () => [
    {
      input: `What's the capital of France?`,
      expected: `Paris`,
    },
    {
      input: `What's the capital of Germany?`,
      expected: `Berlin`,
    },
  ],
  task: async (input) => {
    const result = streamText({
      model: traceAISDKModel(openai("gpt-4o-mini")),
      system: `
        Answer the question concisely. Answer in as few words as possible.
        Remove full stops from the end of the output.
        If the country has no capital, return '<country> has no capital'.
        If the country does not exist, return 'Unknown'.
      `,
      prompt: input,
    });

    return await result.text;
  },
  scorers: [Factuality, Levenshtein],
});
```

<Aside>

`traceAISDKModel` is a no-op in production, so you can leave it in your code without worrying about performance.

## Testing Whole Conversations

You can also pass messages to the `input` property of the eval. To get autocomplete, you can pass the `CoreMessage` type to the `evalite` function as a type argument.

The three type parameters for `evalite` are:

- The type of the input
- The type of the output
- The type of the expected output (optional)

```ts
// my-eval.eval.ts

import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { streamText, type CoreMessage } from "ai";
import { Levenshtein } from "autoevals";
import { evalite } from "evalite";
import { traceAISDKModel } from "evalite/ai-sdk";

evalite<CoreMessage[], string, string>("Test Capitals", {
  data: async () => [
    {
      input: [
        {
          content: `What's the capital of France?`,
          role: "user",
        },
      ],
      expected: `Paris`,
    },
  ],
  task: async (input) => {
    const result = streamText({
      model: traceAISDKModel(openai("gpt-4o-mini")),
      system: `
        Answer the question concisely. Answer in as few words as possible.
        Remove full stops from the end of the output.
        If the country has no capital, return '<country> has no capital'.
        If the country does not exist, return 'Unknown'.
      `,
      messages: input,
    });

    return await result.text;
  },
  scorers: [Levenshtein],
});
```
