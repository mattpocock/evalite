title: faithfulness
---

Checks if your AI is making things up or sticking to the provided information.

**When to use**: Essential for RAG systems where accuracy matters (medical, legal, financial). Catches when your AI invents facts not in your documents.

**When NOT to use**: If your AI should add knowledge beyond the context, or for creative tasks where invention is desired.

## Example

```ts
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { evalite } from "evalite";
import { faithfulness } from "evalite/scorers";

evalite("RAG Faithfulness", {
  data: [
    {
      input: "What programming languages does John know?",
      expected: {
        groundTruth: [
          "John is a software engineer at XYZ Corp. He specializes in backend development using Python and Go. He has 5 years of experience in the industry.",
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
  task: async () => {
    return "John knows Python, Go, and JavaScript. He also invented TypeScript and works at Google.";
  },
  scorers: [
    {
      scorer: ({ input, output, expected }) =>
        faithfulness({
          question: input,
          answer: output,
          groundTruth: expected.groundTruth,
          model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
        }),
    },
  ],
});
```

## Signature

```ts
function faithfulness(opts: {
  question: string;
  answer: string;
  groundTruth: string[];
  model: LanguageModel;
}): Promise<{
  name: string;
  description: string;
  score: number;
  metadata: Array<{
    statement: string;
    reason: string;
    verdict: number;
  }>;
}>;
```

## Parameters

### question

**Type:** `string`

The question being asked.

### answer

**Type:** `string`

The AI's answer to evaluate. Note: Only supports string output, not multi-turn.

### groundTruth

**Type:** `string[]`

Array of source documents/passages that should support all claims.

### model

**Type:** `LanguageModel`

Language model to use for evaluation.

<Aside>
  This scorer requires the AI SDK. This example uses OpenAI's models via
  `@ai-sdk/openai`. The AI SDK supports [many
  providers](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) including
  Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and more.

## Return Value

Returns an object with:

- `name`: "Faithfulness"
- `description`: Description of what was evaluated
- `score`: Number between 0-1 (percentage of claims supported by ground truth)
- `metadata`: Array of verdicts for each statement with `statement`, `reason`, and `verdict` fields
