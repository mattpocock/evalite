title: exactMatch
---

Checks if your AI's output exactly matches the expected text character-for-character. Returns 1 if they match, 0 otherwise.

**When to use**: For testing structured outputs like JSON, code, or specific phrases that must be exact.

**When NOT to use**: When slight variations in wording are acceptable (use answerSimilarity instead).

:::note
Most scorers in Evalite depend on models or embedding models from the AI SDK. This scorer doesn't require the AI SDK, so if you're not using it, you can import from `evalite/scorers/deterministic` instead.

  ],
  task: async (input) => {
