title: answerSimilarity
---

Checks how similar your AI's answer is to the expected answer in meaning (not exact words). This is a "soft" comparison using embeddings and cosine similarity.

**When to use**: When there are many valid ways to express the correct answer, and you want to allow flexibility in phrasing. Good for cases where multiple phrasings are valid.

**When NOT to use**: When you need to verify specific facts (use answerCorrectness or faithfulness), or need exact matches (use exactMatch).

## Example

```ts
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { evalite } from "evalite";
import { answerSimilarity } from "evalite/scorers";

evalite("Answer Similarity", {
  data: [
    {
      input: "What is the capital of France?",
      expected: {
        reference: "Paris is the capital of France.",
      },
    },
  ],
  task: async (input) => {
    return "The capital city of France is Paris.";
  },
  scorers: [
    {
      scorer: ({ output, expected }) =>
        answerSimilarity({
          answer: output,
          reference: expected.reference,
          embeddingModel: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
        }),
    },
  ],
});
```

## Signature

```ts
async function answerSimilarity(opts: {
  answer: string;
  reference: string;
  embeddingModel: EmbeddingModel;
}): Promise<{
  name: string;
  description: string;
  score: number;
}>;
```

## Parameters

### answer

**Type:** `string`

The AI's answer to evaluate.

### reference

**Type:** `string`

Reference answer for comparison (complete, accurate answer).

### embeddingModel

**Type:** `EmbeddingModel`

Embedding model to use for semantic similarity. Supports any AI SDK embedding model.

<Aside>
  This scorer requires the AI SDK. This example uses OpenAI's embeddings via
  `@ai-sdk/openai`. The AI SDK supports [many
  providers](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) including
  Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and more.

## Return Value

Returns an object with:

- `name`: "Answer Similarity"
- `description`: Description of what was evaluated
- `score`: Number between 0-1 (cosine similarity between embeddings)
