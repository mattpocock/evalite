title: levenshtein
---

Measures string similarity using Levenshtein distance (edit distance), normalized to a 0-1 score. Returns a score from 0 to 1, where 1 means identical strings and 0 means completely different.

**When to use**: For fuzzy string matching when you want to tolerate small typos, spelling variations, or minor differences. Useful for testing outputs that should be close but not necessarily exact.

**When NOT to use**: When exact matches are required (use exactMatch) or when you need semantic similarity that understands meaning (use answerSimilarity).

## Example

```ts
import { evalite } from "evalite";
import { levenshtein } from "evalite/scorers";

evalite("Levenshtein", {
  data: [
    {
      input: "What is the capital of France?",
      expected: {
        reference: "Paris",
      },
    },
  ],
  task: async (input) => {
    return "Pari"; // Typo - missing 's'
  },
  scorers: [
    {
      scorer: ({ output, expected }) =>
        levenshtein({
          actual: output,
          expected: expected.reference,
        }),
    },
  ],
});
```

In this example, the output "Pari" compared to expected "Paris" would score 0.8 (4 matching characters out of 5 maximum length).

## Signature

```ts
async function levenshtein(opts: {
  actual: string;
  expected: string;
}): Promise<{
  name: string;
  description: string;
  score: number;
}>;
```

## Parameters

### actual

**Type:** `string`

The actual output to check.

### expected

**Type:** `string`

The expected string to compare against.

## How it works

The score is calculated as:

```
score = 1 - (edit_distance / max_length)
```

Where:

- `edit_distance` is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) needed to change one string into the other
- `max_length` is the length of the longer string
