title: The Dev Loop

When you're developing evals, you want to iterate quickly. Running your entire test suite every time you make a change can be slow and frustrating.

Evalite gives you several tools to speed up your development workflow: watch mode for automatic re-runs, file filtering to run specific evals, and selective execution to focus on particular test cases.

## Watch Mode

Watch mode automatically re-runs your evals whenever you make changes to your files.

```bash
evalite watch
```

This command watches all `.eval.ts` files in your project and re-runs them whenever they change.

:::tip
Watch mode works best when you cache your model responses. If you're using the AI SDK, consider wrapping your models with Evalite's [`wrapAISDKModel`](/api/ai-sdk) to enable caching. This lets you iterate quickly while keeping your LLM costs minimal—crucial when re-running evals frequently.

## Serve Mode

If you have slow-running evals, you might not want them to re-run every time you make a change. Serve mode runs your evals once and then keeps the UI available for inspection.

```bash
evalite serve
```

This runs your evals once and then serves the UI at `http://localhost:3006`. Your tests won't re-run when files change.

You can then re-run your evals by pressing the "Rerun" button in the UI.

## Run Specific Files

Sometimes you don't want to run your entire eval suite. You can run specific eval files by passing them as arguments:

```bash
evalite my-eval.eval.ts
```

You can also run multiple files at once:

```bash
evalite eval1.eval.ts eval2.eval.ts
```

This works with both `watch` and `serve` modes:

```bash
evalite watch my-eval.eval.ts
evalite serve my-eval.eval.ts
```

## Skip Entire Evals

If you want to temporarily disable an eval without deleting it, you can use `evalite.skip()`:

```ts
evalite.skip("My Eval", {
  data: () => [],
  task: () => {},
});
```

## Focus on Specific Test Cases

Sometimes you want to focus on a single test case within an eval. You can use the `only` flag to do this:

```ts
evalite("My Eval", {
  data: () => [
    { input: "test1", expected: "output1" },
    { input: "test2", expected: "output2", only: true },
    { input: "test3", expected: "output3" },
  ],
  task: async (input) => {
    // Only runs for "test2"
  },
});
```

When any data entry has `only: true`, only those entries will run.
