title: The Dev Loop
---

Speed up development by running evals efficiently with watch mode, file filtering, and selective execution.

## Watch Mode

Watch mode re-runs evals when files change for fast iteration.

```bash
evalite watch
```

Watches `.eval.ts` files and re-runs on changes.

### Hide Table Output

When debugging with `console.log`, hide detailed table to see logs:

```bash
evalite watch --hideTable
```

Keeps score summary, removes results table.

### Serve Mode Alternative

Run evals once and serve UI without re-running on changes:

```bash
evalite serve
```

Runs once, keeps UI at `http://localhost:3006`. Tests won't re-run on file changes.

To re-run after changes, restart `evalite serve`.

Useful for slow-running evals.

## Run Specific Files

Run specific eval files instead of all evals:

```bash
evalite my-eval.eval.ts
```

Multiple files:

```bash
evalite eval1.eval.ts eval2.eval.ts
```

Works with `watch` and `serve`:

```bash
evalite watch my-eval.eval.ts
evalite serve my-eval.eval.ts
```

Useful when working on specific eval, avoiding full suite.

## Skip Entire Evals

Use `evalite.skip()` to skip eval without running:

```ts
evalite.skip("My Eval", {
  data: () => [],
  task: () => {},
});
```

Useful for temporarily disabling eval during development.

## Focus on Specific Test Cases

Use `only` flag on data entries to focus on specific inputs:

```ts
evalite("My Eval", {
  data: () => [
    { input: "test1", expected: "output1" },
    { input: "test2", expected: "output2", only: true },
    { input: "test3", expected: "output3" },
  ],
  task: async (input) => {
    // Only runs for "test2"
  },
});
```

When any data entry has `only: true`, only those evals run.
