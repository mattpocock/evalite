title: What Is Evalite?
---

import { Aside, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Evalite runs your evals on a local dev server. It lets you scale up to thousands of evals with ease and powerful controls. If you don't know what evals are, [see below](#what-are-evals).

For folks coming from frontend testing, Evalite is like Jest or Vitest, but for apps that use AI.

Here are the headlines:

- Lets you write evals in `.eval.ts` files.
- Runs a local server on `localhost:3006`
- Lets you write scorers for your evals to score your system's performance
- Can run on CI, producing a static HTML bundle for viewing in CI artifacts
- Based on Vitest, so you can use all the same tools (mocks, lifecycle hooks) you're used to

## What Are Evals?

Most AI-powered apps have behaviors that are probabilistic. They sometimes work, and sometimes don't. Evals are a way to throw a TON of data at your system and see how it performs.

So **evals are to AI-powered apps what tests are to regular apps**. They're a way to check that your app is working well enough to ship.

But AI-powered apps are different - so evals are different too. Normal tests give you a pass or fail metric. **Evals give you a score from 0-100** based on how well your app is performing.

Instead of `.test.ts` files, Evalite uses `.eval.ts` files. They look like this:

```ts
// my-eval.eval.ts

import { evalite } from "evalite";
import { exactMatch } from "evalite/scorers";

evalite("My Eval", {
  // 1. A set of data to test
  data: [{ input: "Hello", expected: "Hello World!" }],
  // 2. The task to perform, usually to call a LLM.
  task: async (input) => {
    return input + " World!";
  },
  // 3. Optionally, some scorers to score the eval
  scorers: [
    // For instance, exactMatch checks if the output
    // matches the expected value exactly
    {
      scorer: ({ output, expected }) =>
        exactMatch({ actual: output, expected }),
    },
  ],
});
```

In the code above, we have:

- `data`: A dataset to test
- `task`: The task to perform
- `scorers`: Methods to score the eval

These are the core elements of an eval.

## Why Does Evalite Exist?

There are plenty of eval runners out there. But most of them are also bundled with a cloud service.

Coming from a frontend testing background, this felt pretty strange to me. I wanted to be able to run evals locally, and not have to worry about vendor lock-in.

So Evalite is **local-only**. It runs on your machine, and you stay in complete control of your data.

This means no friction, no sign-off, and no vendor lock-in. Just you, your code, and your evals.
