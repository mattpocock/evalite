Scorers are used to score the output of your LLM call.

## Built-in Scorers

Evalite provides ready-to-use scorers for common evaluation patterns. See [Built-in Scorers](/api/scorers) for the complete list.

## Third-Party Scorers

[Autoevals](https://github.com/braintrustdata/autoevals) is a great library of scorers to get you started.

## Inline Scorers

If you don't need your scorer to be reusable, you can define it inline.

```ts
import { evalite } from "evalite";

evalite("My Eval", {
  data: [{ input: "Hello" }],
  task: async (input) => {
    return input + " World!";
  },
  scorers: [
    {
      name: "Contains Paris",
      description: "Checks if the output contains the word 'Paris'.",
      scorer: ({ output }) => {
        return output.includes("Paris") ? 1 : 0;
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

## Creating Reusable Scorers

If you have a scorer you want to use across multiple files, you can use `createScorer` to create a reusable scorer.

```ts
import { createScorer } from "evalite";

const containsParis = createScorer<string, string>({
  name: "Contains Paris",
  description: "Checks if the output contains the word 'Paris'.",
  scorer: ({ output }) => {
    return output.includes("Paris") ? 1 : 0;
  },
});

evalite("My Eval", {
  data: [{ input: "Hello" }],
  task: async (input) => {
    return input + " World!";
  },
  scorers: [containsParis],
});
```

The `name` and `description` of the scorer will be displayed in the Evalite UI.

## Score Properties

The `score` function receives three properties on the object passed:

```ts
import { createScorer } from "evalite";

const containsParis = createScorer<string, string>({
  name: "Contains Paris",
  description: "Checks if the output contains the word 'Paris'.",
  scorer: ({ input, output, expected }) => {
    // input comes from `data`
    // expected also comes from `data`
    // output is the output of `task`
    return output.includes("Paris") ? 1 : 0;
  },
});
```

These are typed using the three type arguments passed to `createScorer`:

```ts
import { createScorer } from "evalite";

const containsParis = createScorer<
  string, // Type of 'input'
  string, // Type of 'output'
  string // Type of 'expected'
>({
  name: "Contains Word",
  description: "Checks if the output contains the specified word.",
  scorer: ({ output, input, expected }) => {
    // output is typed as string!
    return output.includes(expected) ? 1 : 0;
  },
});
```

If `expected` is omitted, it will be inferred from the type of `output`.

## Scorer Metadata

You can provide metadata along with your custom scorer:

```ts
import { createScorer } from "evalite";

const containsParis = createScorer<string>({
  name: "Contains Paris",
  description: "Checks if the output contains the word 'Paris'.",
  scorer: (output) => {
    return {
      score: output.includes("Paris") ? 1 : 0,
      metadata: {
        // Can be anything!
      },
    };
  },
});
```

This will be visible along with the score in the Evalite UI.

This is especially useful for debugging LLM-as-a-judge evals. In autoevals `Factuality` scorer, the metadata will include a rationale for why the scorer gave the score it did.
