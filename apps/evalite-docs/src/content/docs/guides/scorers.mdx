Evals are great for putting a ton of data through your system and checking the outputs. But scanning through all that data manually is hard work.

Scorers give you a way to benchmark your system. Instead of "yeah, that looks good", you can say "our system scored 90% on this test".

## Built-in Scorers

Evalite provides ready-to-use scorers for common evaluation patterns. See [Built-in Scorers](/api/scorers) for the complete list.

## Custom Scorers

Evalite lets you create custom scorers to suit your needs. You specify them in the `scorers` array of the `evalite` function:

```ts
import { evalite } from "evalite";

evalite("My Eval", {
  data: [{ input: "Hello" }],
  task: async (input) => {
    return input + " World!";
  },
  scorers: [
    {
      name: "Contains Paris",
      description: "Checks if the output contains the word 'Paris'.",
      scorer: ({ output }) => {
        return output.includes("Paris") ? 1 : 0;
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### The `scorer` function

The `scorer` function receives the input, output, and expected values. It must return a number between 0 and 1.

```ts
({ input, output, expected }) => {
  return output.includes("Paris") ? 1 : 0;
},
```

It can also be `async`, allowing you to perform asynchronous like contacting LLM's or searching databases:

```ts
({ input, output, expected }) => {
  const response = await generateObject({
    // Your AI SDK call here
  })

  return response.object.score;
},
```

### Metadata

You can provide metadata along with your custom scorer:

```ts
import { createScorer } from "evalite";

const containsParis = createScorer<string>({
  name: "Contains Paris",
  description: "Checks if the output contains the word 'Paris'.",
  scorer: (output) => {
    return {
      score: output.includes("Paris") ? 1 : 0,
      metadata: {
        // Can be anything!
      },
    };
  },
});
```

This will be visible along with the score in the Evalite UI. This is especially useful when you call LLM's inside scorers - you can include the reasoning from the LLM in the metadata.

## Reusable Scorers

If you have a scorer you want to use across multiple files, you can use `createScorer` to create a reusable scorer. See [createScorer()](/api/create-scorer) for more details.

These are typed using the three type arguments passed to `createScorer`:

```ts
import { createScorer } from "evalite";

const containsParis = createScorer<
  string, // Type of 'input'
  string, // Type of 'output'
  string // Type of 'expected'
>({
  name: "Contains Word",
  description: "Checks if the output contains the specified word.",
  scorer: ({ output, input, expected }) => {
    return output.includes(expected) ? 1 : 0;
  },
});
```
