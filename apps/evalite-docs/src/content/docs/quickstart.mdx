We're going to walk through setting up Evalite in an existing project.

<Steps>

1. Install `evalite`, `vitest`, and a scoring library like `autoevals`:

   ```bash
   pnpm add -D evalite vitest autoevals
   ```

2. Add an `eval:dev` script to your package.json:

   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "eval:dev": "evalite watch"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Create your first eval:

   ```ts
   // my-eval.eval.ts

   import { evalite } from "evalite";
   import { Levenshtein } from "autoevals";

   evalite("My Eval", {
     // A function that returns an array of test data
     // - TODO: Replace with your test data
     data: async () => {
       return [{ input: "Hello", expected: "Hello World!" }];
     },
     // The task to perform
     // - TODO: Replace with your LLM call
     task: async (input) => {
       return input + " World!";
     },
     // The scoring methods for the eval
     scorers: [Levenshtein],
   });
   ```

   `.eval.ts` is the extension Evalite looks for when scanning for evals.

   </Aside>

4. Run `pnpm run eval:dev`.

   ```bash
   pnpm run eval:dev
   ```

   This runs `evalite`, which runs the evals:

   - Runs the `data` function to get the test data
   - Runs the `task` function on each test data
   - Scores the output of the `task` function using the `scorers`
   - Saves the results to a sqlite database in `node_modules/.evalite`

   It then:

   - Shows a UI for viewing the traces, scores, inputs and outputs at http://localhost:3006.
   - If you only ran one eval, it also shows a table summarizing the eval in the terminal.

5. Open http://localhost:3006 in your browser to view the results of the eval.

</Steps>

### What Next?

Head to the [AI SDK example](/examples/ai-sdk) to see a fully-fleshed out example of Evalite in action.

### Troubleshooting

##### Error: Could not locate the bindings file
Some users experienced issues running `evalite watch`. Your package manager will report the following error message:

```
Command failed, Error: Could not locate the bindings file.
```

This error is related to the `better-sqlite3` package. To resolve this, you can try the following steps:

-  Rebuild `better-sqlite3`:
  ```bash
  pnpm rebuild better-sqlite3
  ```

-  Approve the rebuild of the package with:
  ```bash
  pnpm approve-builds
  ```
